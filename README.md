# charlieplexing_low_power_flasher
An Arduino Nano LED flasher with a Charlieplexing display and low-power features. This will be used in a flasher project for Burning Man 2017.

This project and repository are a work-in-progress. 

### Next steps: ###

- Code to assure that it's really sundown/night and start some rough timing (since we aren't using a RTC and a lot of functionality is turned off during the low power naps). For this project, "rough is good enough"Â®
- Code to change the flash rates during the night (for even more power savings when we start flashing and much later during the early morning)
