# arduino_charlieplexing_flasher
An Arduino Nano LED flasher with a Charlieplexing display and low-power features. This will be used in a flasher project for Burning Man 2017.

This project and repository are a work-in-progress. The code is a bit half-baked at this moment... Adding LDR code so the flasher only runs at night is the next change.
